# My journey to learning java

Hi! I'm someone who's interesting in programming and has started their journey with java. Currently a student in high school and taking a computer science class.

I know the basics of java, I took a class on it at my school. Now I'm trying to learn more advanced topics on it.
I'm using Visual Studio Basic as my IDE, Maven as my builder, JavaCord as my dependancy to build the bot, and using junit for testing

I'm not gonna lie, the folders do look kind of wack. I'm not too sure if this is how I properly set them up, I just followed JavaCord to setup the environment with Maven. I'll look at some github projects later and see how I could/should fix them.
