# My journey to learning java

Hi! I'm someone who's interesting in programming and has started their journey with java. Currently a student in high school and taking a computer science class.

I know the basics of java, I took a class on it at my school. Now I'm trying to learn more advanced topics on it.
I'm using Visual Studio Basic as my IDE, Maven as my builder, JavaCord as my dependancy to build the bot, and using junit for testing

## Goals for this bot

1. Make it tell jokes
2. Checks the status of a minecraft server
3. Keep a running list of people who say a phrase
4. Retrieve info from a wiki, mc related
5. Input a user query into stack exchange and print out X results
6. Start a mc server using my discord bot

## Notes

I was doing the whole stackexchange wrong lmao. I was trying to do "explicit flow" and etc. while I was supposed to be doing an advanced GET search

## Currently working on

Getting a command from the user with a query then inputting that
Also, probably looking into expanding the "quota" while accessing the stackexchange API
